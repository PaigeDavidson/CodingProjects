Command to get into the database and be able to run commands:
    *  mysql -u root -p hw3
    * to exit: just type "exit"
    * I didn't initalize a password for this one so you can just press enter on the passwords

Command to run a queries file on a database and send the output to a txt file:
    * mysql -u root -p hw3 --batch --raw < Queries.sql > output.txt
    * This command runs the queries in Queries.txt on the hw3 database and creates a file (Output.txt) to send the output to

Command to run a .sql query file on a database and output the results to the terminal
    * mysql -u root -p hw3 < Queries.sql
    * Where hw3 is the database and Queries.sql is the file with my queries in it

Starting and stopping sql:
    * to start: brew services start mysql
    * to check the services that are running: brew services list
    * to stop: brew services stop mysql

Creating a database
    * You can just create one with a couple of steps:
        * get into the sql moniter with commandL: mysql -u root -p (password = honeybee2212)
        * then run command: CREATE DATABASE <databaseName>;
        * check that is was added to your databases by running command: SHOW databases;
    * Then to build the database with something like the EmployeeDB.sql file:
        * enter command "exit" to leave the sql moniter
        * from directory with the initializing .sql file run the command: mysql -u root -p <databaseName> <InitializeFileNamee.sql>

Resetting the password for root:
    * Start MySQL with --skip-grant-tables and --skip-networking
        This approach ensures MySQL starts without the privilege tables and networking, allowing you to reset the root password or change authentication methods.

        Stop MySQL (if running):

        sudo killall mysqld
        Start MySQL in safe mode (with --skip-grant-tables and --skip-networking to bypass authentication checks and prevent network connections):

        sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
        Log in to MySQL: Now try logging in without a password:
        mysql -u root
    * Change Authentication Method
        Once inside MySQL, the root user might be using an authentication method like auth_socket instead of the typical password-based authentication. To fix this:

        Switch to the MySQL database:

        USE mysql;
        Change the root user's authentication method to use mysql_native_password:

        UPDATE user SET plugin='mysql_native_password' WHERE User='root';
        Set a password for the root user (if needed):

        UPDATE user SET authentication_string=PASSWORD('newpassword') WHERE User='root';
        Flush privileges to apply the changes:

        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    * Restart MySQL Normally
        Stop MySQL: If MySQL is still running in safe mode, stop it:

        sudo killall mysqld
        Start MySQL normally: If you're using Homebrew, run:

        brew services restart mysql
        Or if you're using MySQL's native setup:

        sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start
    * log in with new password:
        mysql -u root -p
